## ðŸ‘‹ Intro

This project was bootstrapped with the [React Boilerplate Builder](https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-boilerplate-builder) by [Matt McNamee](https://mcnam.ee).

- __Flux architecture__

    - Redux Wrapper: [Rematch](https://github.com/rematch/rematch)
- __Routing and navigation__
    - [React Native Router Flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux) for native mobile navigation
- __Data Caching / Offline__
    - [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
- __UI Toolkit/s__
    - [Native Base](https://nativebase.io/) for native mobile
- __Code Linting__ with
    - [Airbnb's JS Linting](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) guidelines
- __Deployment strategy__
    - [Both manual and automated strategies](/documentation/deploy.md)
