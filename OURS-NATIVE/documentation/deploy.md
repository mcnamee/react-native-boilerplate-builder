# ðŸš€ Deploying

## Setting up a new app to deploy:

1. Ensure you have admin access to the destination Google Play and Apple/iTunesConnect Developer accounts
1. Ensure you've named your app correctly and set a unique bundle identifier:
    - Use [react-native-rename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-rename)
        - eg. `react-native-rename "Travel App" -b com.junedomingo.travelapp`
    - Open the project in Xcode and double check that the Bundle ID has been updated (if not, correct it)
1. Generate/configure Android key:
    - `( cd android/app && keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore android-release-key.keystore -alias jims-app-release-key -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 )` (note: change `jims-app-release-key` to your own alias)
    - Update the values of the alias and password/s (that you set in the previous command) in: `android/gradle.properties`
    - Save the key to a secure password safe (don't commit it to the repo)
1. In both Google Play and iTunes Connect:
    - Setup a new app
    - Use the _manual_ method below to build and deploy the app for the first time
        - _iOS Note: when you deploy the iOS app for the first time, you'll select 'Automatic Key Management'. Xcode will generate a private distribution key. Ensure you save this (eg. to a password safe) so that others can distribute the app too_
1. For Fastlane:
    - Using the __account owner's__ login (i.e. we want to create the API credentials from the owner's account) - follow the [steps here](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/supply/#setup) to generate API credentials for Google Play. Download and place the json file here: `android/app/google-play-android-developer.json`. Save the key to a secure password safe (don't commit it to the repo)
    - Update the `package_name` and `itc_team_id` (App Store Connect Team ID) in `faslane/Appfile` to match the bundle of your app
    - Update the following in `fastlane/Fastfile`:
        - `app_identifier: com.app.bundle` - where com.app.bundle is your bundle id
        - `name.xcodeproj` - to the name of your Xcode project file
        - `scheme: 'name'` - where name is your scheme (eg. AppName)
    - Run `fastlane supply init` (which will download the meta data of the uploaded app, from the stores)

## Configuring your machine, to deploy:

1. Android (Google Play):
    - Add the Android keys (found in the password safe) to your local project:
        - `android/app/android-release-key.keystore`
        - `android/app/google-play-android-developer.json`
    - [Android/Google dependencies](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started#installing-dependencies-1)
1. iOS (Apple iTunes Connect):
    - In Xcode, login to the appropriate account to give you access to deploy
    - Must be running on a Mac with the latest Xcode
    - Install the appropriate distribution private key (found in the password safe)
        - Download the file and double click it to add to Keychain
1. Fastlane (for automated deployments on both platforms):
    - Install Fastlane - `brew cask install fastlane`
    - Install Xcode command line tools - `xcode-select --install`

---

## 1.0 Deploying:

- Update the __app version__ - `bash fastlane/update-app-version.sh`
- __Merge__ `develop` branch into `master` branch with a _merge commit_
- Git __Tag__ the master merge commit. The tag name should be the new version number
- Bundle and deploy by the following:

## 2.1 (Automated) Fastlane

Fastlane automatically builds and deploys the app to the app stores (TestFlight and Play Store Beta).

 1. _Hint: Did you update the version number, merge to master and tag?_
 1. __iOS__: Deploy to Apple TestFlight - `fastlane ios beta`
 1. __Android__: Deploy to Google Play Beta - `fastlane android beta`

## 2.2 Manual

### 2.2.1 iOS

_*Note: it may be required to use the legacy build system (XCode -> File -> Project Settings -> Change the build system to 'Legacy Build System')_

1. _Hint: Did you update the version number, merge to master and tag?_
1. Ensure you've changed the Xcode 'Build Config' to Release
1. Select 'Generic iOS Device' from devices
1. Product > Archive
1. Open Organiser
    - Find the archive and click 'Validate' to check that it's ok
    - Click the big 'Upload to App Store...' when ready (untick BitCode checkbox)

### 2.2.2 Android

1. _Hint: Did you update the version number, merge to master and tag?_
1. `( cd android && ./gradlew app:bundleRelease )`
1. Upload the generated file (`/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app.aab`) to Google Play
