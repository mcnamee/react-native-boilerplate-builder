## ðŸ‘‹ Intro

This project was bootstrapped with the [React Boilerplate Builder](https://github.com/mcnamee/react-native-boilerplate-builder) by [Matt McNamee](https://mcnam.ee).

The project is _super_ helpful to kick-start your next project, as it provides a lot of the common tools you may reach for, all ready to go. Specifically:

- __[Expo](https://expo.io/)__ - The fastest way to build an app
- __Flux architecture__
    - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)
    - Redux Wrapper: [Rematch](https://github.com/rematch/rematch)
- __Routing and navigation__
    - [React Native Router Flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux)
- __Data Caching / Offline__
    - [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
- __UI Toolkit/s__
    - [Native Base](https://nativebase.io/)
- __Code Linting__ with
    - [Airbnb's JS Linting](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) guidelines

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

 - Install `eslint`, `prettier` and `editor config` plugins into your IDE
 - Ensure your machine has the Expo CLI Installed (`npm install -g expo-cli`)

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the App
# - The Expo CLI will provide options to open in [web, android or iOS]
yarn start
```
